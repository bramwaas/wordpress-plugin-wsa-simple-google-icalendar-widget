Widget that displays events from a public google calendar or iCal file.
 
== Description ==

Simple widget to display events from a public google calendar, microsoft office outlook calendar or an other iCal file, in the style of your website.

This simple widget fetches events from a public google calendar (or other calendar in iCal format) and displays them in simple list allowing you to fully adapt to your website by applying all kinds of CSS. 
Google offers some HTML snippets to embed your public Google Calendar into your website.
These are great, but as soon as you want to make a few adjustments to the styling, that goes beyond changing some colors, they're not enough.

== Plugin Features ==

* Calendar widget to display appointments/events of a public Google calendar or other iCal file.
* Small footprint, uses only Google ID of the calendar, or ICS link for Outlook, or Url of iCal file, to get event information via iCal
* Manage events in Google Calendar, or other iCalendar source.
* Fully adaptable to your website with CSS. Output in unorderd list with Bootstrap 4 listgroup classes and toggle for details.
* Choose date / time format in admin screen that best suits your website.
* Displays per event DTSTART, DTEND, SUMMARY, LOCATION and DESCRIPTION. DTSTART is required other components are optional. 

== Installation ==

* Do the usual setup procedure... you know... downloading... unpacking... uploading... activating. 
Or just install it through the wordpress plugin directory.
* As soon as you activated the plugin, you should see a new widget under Design / Widgets.
Just drag it into your sidebar.
* Fill out all the necessary configuration fields.
 Under Calendar ID enter the calendar ID displayed by Google Calendar, or complete url of a  Google calendar or other iCal file.
 You can find Google calendar ID by going to Calendar Settings / Calendars, clicking on the appropriate calendar, scrolling all the way down to find the Calendar ID at the bottom under the Integrate Calendar section. There's your calendar id.
* You're done!

= Can I use HTML in the description of the appointement?  =

 You can use HTML in the most Calendars, but the result in the plugin may not be what you expect.
 First most calendars will only give the plain text in the Description in the iCal output.
 Secondly this plugin filters the HTML to convert characters that have special significance in HTML to the corresponding HTML-entities. So if you manage to get the HTML in the description the output wil not be what you expect.
 In case you have all kinds of HTML in your appointments a plugin that uses the API of te calendar-application might be a better choice for you. 

= How to use Microsoft Office Outlook Calendar? =

First you have to share your calendar to make it public available, or to create and share a public calendar. Private calendars cannot be accessed by this plugin.
Then publish it as  an ICS link and use this link address. (something like https://outlook.live.com/owa/calendar/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/.../cid-.../calendar.ics) (works from version 1.3.1 of this widget)

= How to use Apple Calendar (iCloud Mac/ios)? =
Choose the calendar you want to share. On the line of that calendar click on the radio symbol (a dot with three quart circles) right in that line. In the pop up Calendar Sharing check the box Public Calendar. You see the url below something like webcal://p59-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/MTQxNzk0NDA2NjE0MTc5AAAAAXt2Dy6XXXXXPXXxuZnTLDV9xr6A6_m3r_GU33Qj. Click on Copy Link and OK. Paste that in the "Calendar ID, or iCal URL" field of the widget (before version 1.3.1 you have to change webcal in https)

= Error: cURL error 28: Operation timed out after 5000 milliseconds with 0 bytes received =

Probably the calendar is not public (yet), you can copy the link before the agenda is actually published. Check if the agenda has already been published and try again.

= I only see the headline of the calendar, but no events =

There are no events found within the selection. Test e.g. with an appointment for the next day and refresh the cache or wait till the cache is refreshed.
Check if you can download the ics file you have designated in the widget with a browser. At least if it is a text file with the first line "BEGIN:VCALENDAR" and further lines "BEGIN:VEVENT" and lines "END:VEVENT". If you cannot resolve it, you can of course report an error / question in our
[community support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simple-google-icalendar-widget)

= Can I use an event calendar that only uses days, not times, like a holiday calendar? =

 Yes you can, since v1.2.0, I have tested with [https://p24-calendars.icloud.com/holiday/NL_nl.ics](https://p24-calendars.icloud.com/holiday/NL_nl.ics) .

== Upgrade Notice ==

* since v1.2.0 Wordpress version 5.3.0 is required because of the use of wp_date() 

== Changelog ==
* 1.4.0 added parameter excerptlength to limit the length in characters of the description in respons to a comment of justmigrating (@justmigrating).
        Fixed a trim error that occurred in a previous version, revising the entire trimming so that both \r\n and \n end of lines are handled properly
        12-7-2021 tested with 5.8-RC2 and set tested up to to 5.8
* 1.3.1 tested with Outlook and found that different timezones were a problem, solved by using a conversion tabel between Microsoft timezones and Iana timezones and using local (Wordpress configuration) timezone when timezone is unknown.
Also found that colon ended description and summary. Found a solution for that so now you can use a colon in a description or a summary.
Tested with iCloud Apple Calendar, timezones seem to be Iana. Issue with url starting with webcal protocol in stead of http or https, work around is substituting webcal with https:, but solved by change in url check and stricter validation Google Id.
* 1.3.0 made time formats of appointment/event times configurable in response to a comment of carolynclarkdfw (@carolynclarkdfw) on the plugin page. Tested with wordpress 5.7
* 1.2.2 added a checkbox to clear cache before expiration in response to a comment of TrojanObelix. 
* 1.2.1 handle not available DTEND => !isset($e->end) in response to a comment of lillyberger (@lillyberger) on the plugin page, by defaulting $e->end to DTSTART value.
        tested with https://p24-calendars.icloud.com/holiday/NL_nl.ics
* 1.2.0 adjustment not to display time on events that have DTSTART in DATE format instead of DATETIME format after a comment of TrojanObelix.
		found that date_i18n($format, $timestamp) formats according to the locale, but not the timezone so times and sometimes also dates 
		went wrong, but the newer function wp_date() does, so date_i18n() replaced bij wp_date() (that means wp 5.3.0 is now required).
		adjusted use of ID's for the events also to work when lineseperator is \n  in stead of \r\n after seeing example by of TrojanObelix.
		Tested with WP 5.5.3.		
* 1.1.0 parse EXDATE to exclude events from repeat
* 1.0.3 trim only "\n\r\0" and first space but keep last space in Description Summary and Location lines.
        adjustments to correct timezone that is ignored in new datetime when the $time parameter is a UNIX timestamp (e.g. @946684800) 
* 1.0.2 Adjustments for multiline Description, summary or location. Tested with wp 5.2.1.
* 1.0.1 PHP 7.2 deprecated create_function changed in anonymous function in widget_init. Tested with wp 5.0.3
* 1.0.0 first version in WP plugin directory, directory and start php renamed after slug simple-google-icalendar-widget
* 0.7.0 BYDAY with DAILY frequency tested. Test code deleted. Present as RC to wordpress.
* 0.6.0 BYDAY and BYMONTHDAY work with complete sorting and unifying in MONTH frequency
        adding class suffixes from setting.
* 0.5.0 BYDAY complete first try with sort tested with wordpress 4.8.3 php 7
* 0.3.5 discard non existent days like 31th november first try with byday
		works als with complete url to ical .ics file.
		renamed plugin to simple-google-i-calendar-widget and 
		renamed references gcal to ical		
* 0.3.3 simple repeating events (only full periods) works* 0.7.0 BYDAY with DAILY frequency tested. Test code deleted. Present as RC to wordpress.
* 0.2.0 starting work on repeating events 
* 0.1.0 Added support for start and end time with timezone
		Changed lay-out of output of teh widget so that is more in line with bootstrap 4 and with the iframe-widget of google
		a lot of small changes eg: better support for events in a timezone and events that last a whole day. Replace escaped chars for summary,
		description and location. Refinements in output HTML.
		renamed starting .php file to simple-google-calendar-widget.php
